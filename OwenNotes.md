this is me trying to figure stuff out 
what i need to do:
- figure out how github works
  - solve the folder problem
- read through the files here and understand what they do
- add comments to all existing code. BRUH you are a nerd
- start writing code
  - upvote system
  - fix for the case of no content

other ideas i have:
not married to any of these
- draw out what we want each page of this website to look like
  by hand and commit to it, at least for the site's full 1st draft
  - feel like this would be much more efficient than verbally ideating
    and then experimenting with actual code - drawing is fast and shows
    us whether the ideas look good or bad
      - yes agree, we can also maybe use Figma for this 
- use the readme to explain what's going on file by file (for my own sake)
  - ok yeah I'll change mine to notes and then make the readme more sensical

questions:
- what resources have you been using to figure out how to do this stuff?
   - supersimpledev free Youtube courses (videos) about HTML/CSS/Js. He's great at explaining stuff but it does take a while. Honestly I think getting a solid background in the languages is worth the time investment. On web scraping, I've used a hodge podge of resources and honestly learned through doing for legal tech guy so I would just look up BeautifulSoup and Selenium practice scraping exercises. 
- what have you already tried wrt the folder problem? like where should i 
  not waste my time
  - I think you have to have index.html in the outer directory or possibly create a dummy index.html that's in the outer directory that links to the real one if it's in a folder
  - I haven't really tried much but will play with it and update. You'll have to update the paths between the html files and css files if you change the folders (go to the head section of index.html and look for <link rel="stylesheet">. The paths are done similarly to ones from AP, ../ works for going back a folder etc
