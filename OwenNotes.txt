this is me trying to figure stuff out 
what i need to do:
- figure out how github works
  - figure out the folder problem
- read through the files here and understand what they do
- add comments to all existing code
- start writing code
  - upvote system
  - fix for the case of no content

other ideas i have:
not married to any of these
- draw out what we want each page of this website to look like
  by hand and commit to it, at least for the site's full 1st draft
- use the readme to explain what's going on file by file
