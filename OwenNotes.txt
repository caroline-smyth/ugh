this is me trying to figure stuff out 
what i need to do:
- figure out how github works
  - solve the folder problem
- read through the files here and understand what they do
- add comments to all existing code
- start writing code
  - upvote system
  - fix for the case of no content

other ideas i have:
not married to any of these
- draw out what we want each page of this website to look like
  by hand and commit to it, at least for the site's full 1st draft
  - feel like this would be much more efficient than verbally ideating
    and then experimenting with actual code - drawing is fast and shows
    us whether the ideas look good or bad 
- use the readme to explain what's going on file by file (for my own sake)

questions:
- what resources have you been using to figure out how to do this stuff?
  which of these would help me quickly understand all this code?
- what have you already tried wrt the folder problem? like where should i 
  not waste my time?
